# Minimal_IP_stack
A minimal UDP/IP stack for the N.I.G.E. Machine

A minimal IP stack in FORTH for the N.I.G.E. Machine

The purpose of this package is to support a UDP/IP terminal on the N.I.G.E. Machine via the Nexys4 / Nexys4DDR Ethernet adapter.  Functionality will be made available through a wordset comprising the usual FORTH terminal words  `Uemit, Utype, Ukey, Ukey?`.  The plan is to aim for the minimum required for a working UDP terminal and then add functionality over time as the need arises
